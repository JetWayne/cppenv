Cppenv: Complete vim environment for coding C++
===============================================

## Overview

##### My aim was making coding C++ fast, automation, and correctly. So, I choosed vim as our editor, because his shortcut keys often need single press. But, I want to more...

##### This project has two parts:

    1.Complete vim environment installer.
  
    2.Vim plugin for coding C++
  
##### Vim environment includes some tools below:
    
    g++
    git
    cmake
    python2
    
##### and some plugins below:

    Vundle
    YouCompleteMe
    NerdTree
    Airline
    taglist
    vim-snippet
    
##### You can run the script `autoconf/install.sh` to install all of the vim environment I provide. It will automation install all of the tools and plugins above. If you are in Chinese, it maybe cost only 4 minutes.
